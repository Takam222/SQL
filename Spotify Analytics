# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE TA_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#Who are the Top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT track_name as Song, artist_name as Artist, popularity as Popularity
FROM TA_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10

#Which Artist on the list released the longest song?

SELECT track_name as Song, artist_name as Artist, duration_ms as Duration
FROM TA_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY Duration DESC 
LIMIT 1
