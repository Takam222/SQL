##In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(OrderID)
FROM TA_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(OrderID)
FROM TA_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID' 
AND Product='iPhone'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum
FROM TA_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN TA_DB.customers customers
ON feb.orderid=customers.order_id 
WHERE acctnum IS NOT NULL

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT product, price
FROM TA_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM TA_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product 

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, 
how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, quantity, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM TA_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, 
and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(acctnum) as customers, AVG(quantity*price) AS average
FROM TA_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN TA_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#8. List all the products sold in LA in Februrary, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT distinct Product, SUM(Quantity) as Sum
FROM TA_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY product

#9. Which locations in New York recieved at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each recieve?

SELECT Location, count(orderID) as Orders
FROM TA_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like "%NY%"
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) > 2
